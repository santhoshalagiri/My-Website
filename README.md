# My-Website

It's my personal portfolio that I designed during the Summer break.

I learned how to code in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and designed this website. 

My portfolio has,

1. Color changing options. (feel free to press those buttons)

2. LinkedIn Profile

3. Github Profile

4. Screenshot of my LinkedIn Recommendations

5. List of all of the few projects that I've completed and working on..
